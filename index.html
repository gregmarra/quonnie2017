        <p class="lead">Please join us in Quonochontaug, Rhode Island to celebrate Greg &amp; Lily's wedding.</p>

          <h4>Travel</h4>
          <p>Our wedding will be at Quonochontaug Pond, Charlestown, Rhode Island. If you want to come out earlier in the week, we'd love to have you!</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hotel:</strong> We have a hotel block in Mystic, CT at the Hampton Inn &amp; Suites with only a 1 night minimum. When you call, either book your own room directly, or if they run out, ask to rebook one of the rooms currently held under Greg Marra. Room rates will be lower if you have a Hilton Honors rewards number, which is free to register for. The hotel is about a 25 minute drive from the venue, and selected to be easier for people traveling from Connecticut.</li>
            <li><strong>Bed and Breakfast:</strong> We have ~10 rooms at a bed and breakfast, the Shelter Harbor Inn, about 10 minutes away from the venue. The rooms are for 2 night stays (Fri/Sat). You can probably pack a lot of people into each room. (The folks at the inn are a little disorganized, we do have the rooms reserved. Ask them to book you for 7/7 &amp; 7/8 in the barn for the Stanton Marra wedding).</li>
            <li><strong>Camping:</strong> The Burlingame state campground is a few minutes away from Quonnie. There are cabins with bunk beds or campsites, all with access to coin operated showers. We went ahead and booked a few cabins so reach out if you&rsquo;re interested in that. We plan to have a shuttle to bring people to and from on the day of the wedding.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Schedule</h4>
          <p>Saturday is the big day, with other group things on Friday and Sunday, but we&rsquo;ll be there the whole week before if you wanted to be too. Here&rsquo;s a rough schedule.</p>

          <p>Our wedding will be at Quonochontaug Pond, Charlestown, Rhode Island. If you want to come out earlier in the week, we'd love to have you!</p>

            <li><strong>Hotel:</strong> We have a hotel block in Mystic, CT at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hampton+Inn+%26+Suites+Mystic/@41.377549,-71.9614177,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e60a774b2c66c9:0x13568c3ec2ca83c!8m2!3d41.377549!4d-71.959229">Hampton Inn &amp; Suites</a> with only a 1 night minimum. When you call, either book your own room directly, or if they run out, ask to rebook one of the rooms currently held under Greg Marra. Room rates will be lower if you have a Hilton Honors rewards number, which is free to register for. The hotel is about a 25 minute drive from the venue, and selected to be easier for people traveling from Connecticut.<br />

          <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-gift" aria-hidden="true"></span> Registry</h3>
          <p>One of our favorite phrases to describe our relationship is, ‚Äúcomplementary superlatives.‚Äù We have very different strengths and weaknesses. However, the work of <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org">Give Directly</a> resonates with both of us. They are an international development organization run by economists that makes unconditional cash transfers to people living in extreme poverty based on research that has shown the powerful improvements this makes in peoples' lives. Give Directly does randomized controlled trials to measure their impact and answer public policy questions. In this world of dramatic wealth disparity, we appreciate how this organization both provides immediate assistance to people in need and is doing research that will inform public policy for future generations. Please consider a donation to Give Directly in lieu of a wedding present.</p>
          <p>We also understand how fun it is to give tangible objects. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/wedding/share/StantonMarra">Here is a list of objects</a> that will grace our home for years to come. We wrote comments on each of the items in our registry - a few of them contain instructions so be sure to look out for them. Please ship to Greg Marra, 1 Facebook Way, Menlo Park CA 94025 (<strong>not</strong> our home address which can't receive packages).</p>

          <h2>Fun Facts About Greg &amp; Lily</h2>
        </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign" aria-hidden="true"></span> Names</h3>
          <p>We are both changing our names! We want to have the same last name but Lily doesn‚Äôt like hyphens and Greg wants to keep Marra. We will be Greg Stanton Marra and Elizabeth Stanton Marra.</p>
          <p><strong>Stanton</strong></p>
          <p>Lily is a 6th generation "Elizabeth" in her matrilineal line. Stanton is patrilineal; it was Lily‚Äôs grandfather‚Äôs grandmother‚Äôs maiden name. Lily‚Äôs late grandmother, Jill Dixon, loved the Stanton lineage and gave her a sampler made by Mary Stanton in the 1800s. The Stantons settled Stonington, CT, and one John Stanton wrote a dictionary for translation between English and Wampanoag. (Also, hat tip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Cady_Stanton">Elizabeth Cady Stanton</a>, noted suffragette, sadly of no known relation).</p>
          <p><strong>Marra</strong></p>
          <p>Marra is pronounced like a female horse (a <strong>mare</strong>), or like "Greg and Lily are getting <strong>marr</strong>ied". According to the Oxford University Press‚Äôs Dictionary of American Family Names, Marra is a "habitational name from places so called in central and southern Italy, from marra 'heap of stones'. Italian: from marra 'hoe' (from Latin marra), presumably a metonymic occupational name for a maker of such implements or a metonymic occupational name for an agricultural laborer." In Italy, Marra was almost surely pronounced differently than Greg‚Äôs family now pronounces it.</p>
